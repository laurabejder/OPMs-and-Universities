## Data Diary

This document explains the process of data collection and data cleaning of this project.

The original dataset was aquired from this GitHub repository: 

https://github.com/HigherEdData/Outsourcing-Online-Education 

The file [filename] is based on their dataset but we have collected new rounds of data which are also included in the file. 

We filed a new round of FOIA requests to the universities in the original data and as a result of the responses, we have added new partnerships between universities and online program managers.
