## Data Diary

This document explains the process of data collection and data cleaning of this project.

The original dataset was aquired from this GitHub repository: 

https://github.com/HigherEdData/Outsourcing-Online-Education 

The file [filename] is based on their dataset but we have collected new rounds of data which are also included in the file. 

We filed a new round of FOIA requests to the universities in the original data and as a result of the responses, we have added new partnerships between universities and online program managers. 

### Updating the data
We have updated the invisibility meassurement. 


0 - no mention of the partnership on University program website, may have 1 press release from the provost, head of university, etc when the partnership began, but definitely not clear to potential students. You would need to specifically look up key terms 

    1 - Mentioned somewhere on the university website, but not clear that there is an external partnership in place "available but not accessible"

    2 - Partnership is clear on the university programâ€™s website, clear differentiation between the university and an external tool
